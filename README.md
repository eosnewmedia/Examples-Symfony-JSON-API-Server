Example Implementation: JSON API Server with Symfony
====================================================

Run: `composer install` and then `bin/console server:run` to execute this example.

This example currently only contains fetch methods (HTTP GET)!

The example is a simple address book where you have one person with multiple postal addresses.

Resources are `persons` and `postalAddresses`.
